# Render.yaml Configuration Update Summary

## Issue Resolved
The render.yaml file contained deprecated 'starter' plans that are no longer supported by Render for new deployments. These have been updated to current supported plans.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Plan Update
- **Previous Plan:** `starter` (deprecated)
- **New Plan:** `basic-256mb`
- **Location:** Line 63 in render.yaml
- **Cost:** $6/month
- **Specifications:**
  - 256 MB RAM
  - 0.1 CPU
  - 100 connections

### 2. Web Service Plan Update
- **Service Name:** blfantasy-api
- **Previous Plan:** `starter` (deprecated)
- **New Plan:** `free`
- **Location:** Line 5 in render.yaml
- **Cost:** $0/month (with limitations)

### 3. Worker Service Plan Update
- **Service Name:** blfantasy-worker
- **Previous Plan:** `starter` (deprecated)
- **New Plan:** `free`
- **Location:** Line 24 in render.yaml
- **Cost:** $0/month (with limitations)

## Cost Implications

### Current Configuration Costs:
- **Database (basic-256mb):** $6/month
- **Web Service (free):** $0/month
- **Worker Service (free):** $0/month
- **Cron Jobs:** Free (included with services)
- **Total Monthly Cost:** $6/month

### Alternative Plans Available:

#### Database Options:
- **free:** $0/month (30-day limit, 256 MB RAM)
- **basic-1gb:** $19/month (1 GB RAM, 0.5 CPU)
- **basic-4gb:** $75/month (4 GB RAM, 2 CPUs)
- **pro-4gb:** $55/month (4 GB RAM, 1 CPU, better performance)

#### Service Options:
If you need more resources for services:
- **basic:** Starting at $7/month per service
- **standard:** Starting at $25/month per service
- **performance:** Starting at $85/month per service

## Important Notes

1. **Free Tier Limitations:**
   - Free services spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity
   - Free database has a 30-day expiration
   - Limited compute resources

2. **Automatic Sync:**
   - These changes will be automatically synced when you push to your repository
   - Render will provision resources with the new plans
   - There may be brief downtime during the transition

3. **Recommendations:**
   - Monitor your application's performance with the current configuration
   - Consider upgrading to paid service plans if you experience:
     - Slow cold starts due to service spin-down
     - Performance issues with limited resources
   - The basic-256mb database plan should be sufficient for small to medium applications

## Next Steps

1. Commit and push the updated render.yaml to your repository
2. Monitor the Render dashboard for deployment status
3. Verify all services are running correctly after the update
4. Consider setting up alerts for resource usage monitoring

## Migration Path if Needed

If you need to upgrade plans in the future:
1. Update the `plan` field in render.yaml
2. For database storage, you can add `diskSizeGB` field (must be 1 or multiple of 5)
3. Commit and push changes
4. Render will handle the migration automatically

Note: Database storage can only be increased, not decreased. To reduce storage, you would need to create a new database and migrate data.
